                    Hi, I’m Dylan and I’m running to be the President of your Students’ Union.

                    Over the last year I’ve been working as your VP External where I advocated to all levels of government

                    for things like student jobs, tuition, and mental health funding.

                    I want to make school more affordable, build student community from the ground up, and raise revenue

                    for the SU without increasing fees.

                    University needs to stay affordable and to do that, I will be advocating for an affordable U-Pass in our

                    upcoming negotiations, working with the next VPX to rollback tuition, and lobbying for more student

                    grants.

                    Students build student community. This has been forgotten in past years and to ensure this I will be

                    advocating that Residence Associations be able to collect fees, and control of student groups into the

                    hands of the SU.

                    In my term, I will find ways to increase the revenue of the SU outside fees; this means the development

                    of an alumni endowment fund, filling all retail spaces in SUB, and improving our businesses.

                    Finally, I won’t pretend to know everything you care about, so thats why I am allowing you to add your own idea below or If you just want to chat you can email me at hanwell@ualberta.ca

                <p>My platform focuses on three themes. Each of these themes have key action items I want to accomplish to ensure these themes are improved on.</p>
                <div class="theme">

                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                            In the next year, the Students’ Union will go into negotiations with the City of Edmonton and the
                            Edmonton Transit System about the price of U of A students' U-Pass for the next three year. This
                            negotiation presents both an opportunity and a threat for the SU and students. Prices for ETS fares and
                            monthly passes have been rising higher than inflation, and this gives us signals that the U-Pass will also
                            share a greatly increased price tag.
                            </p>

                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                                For the past year I’ve been advocating as the VP External and I have learned a lot about this
                                government. I’ve learned the issues that they care about and their vision for the future. Unlike the past
                                government, they show a willingness to prioritize students as well as an understanding that the cost of
                                tuition is too high. I will work to reduce and regulate tuition.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="actionItem">
                            Increasing grants for low-income students </br>
                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                                There are three main demographic groups that are underrepresented in university; Aboriginal,
                                rural, and low-income students. The Students’ Union has consistently advocated for measures that make
                                post-secondary education more accessible, and non-repayable aid is the best way to do this.
                                </br>
                                In order to incentivize these students to attend university, the Students’ Union should advocate
                                for the creation of a low-income student grant. The grant should be automatic based on family income
                                and be given to all students that attend university from low-income backgrounds. This grant should be
                                the first piece of student aid that is given, with the max amount of $15,000 in student loans to follow, if
                                needed. An approximate amount for the grant would be $5,000/year of study.

                            Protecting the Rights of Residents
                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                                Residence Associations (that are not disbanded by the University) have been denied the
                                ability the collect residence fees that have been democratically approved. It is not only in the
                                best interest of the SU to advocate for these residents, but is also in the interest of the U of A to
                                give a high quality residence experience. It is important that Residence Associations be given
                                the tools to create community from the ground up. One of those tools is the ability to collect fees.
                                </br>
                                Currently all residents sign a tenancy agreement with the University of Alberta, but the
                                documents have little continuity between residences and do not clearly outline the rights and
                                responsibilities that residents have. We need to work to enshrine and entrench a set of rights
                                for all students living in residence.

                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                                This also comes in to effect when Student Groups break any rules of the Student Groups
                                Procedure. Instead of the community of students governing students, the DoS has complete
                                control over all discipline of Student Groups. We have seen that with groups like the LHSA, this
                                power can be used to target groups using punitive instead of restorative justice.
                                </br>
                                The University of Alberta is one of the few schools that shares control of Student Groups
                                between the administration and the Students’ Union. The SU should take control of all student
                                groups to better manage groups and focus on restorative justice with student groups. Individual
                                students are still the responsibility of the DoS office and the Code of Student Behaviour, but
                                Student Groups should be the responsibility of students.

                            <p class="sublistDisc">
                                Over the past year I have heard the term ‘student experience’ again and again but with
                                no real definition. There is an understanding that quality for students exists inside and outside
                                the classroom and that it is important, but no one has been able to accurately measure or
                                quantify it.
                            </br>
                                When I return from elections we will be launching a survey that will give us an
                                understanding of what matters to students in terms of their experience on campus. We have a
                                huge amount of power with that information.

                                When analyzing the businesses that are run by the Students’ Union, it is clear some
                                businesses must become more relevant to students. If elected, I will work with the General
                                Manager and the Senior Manager, Business Development to ensure our businesses remain
                                relevant to students. The businesses I will focus on are: L’Express, SUBmart, Room at the Top
                                (RATT), and Dewey’s.
                            </br>
                                One way of involving students in the process of business development is to create a
                                small board of students that we consult with. Previously we had a board of mainly Business
                                students that would give insight into the management of our businesses, but it has since been
                                dismantled due to the creation of a manager of business development. That said, I would like to
                                bring this board back not to consult on management issues, but on relevancy to students.

                                Graduates are not just alumni of the University of Alberta, but also of the Students’ Union.
                                The University has a strong emphasis on alumni engagement and the SU should as well.
                            </br>
                                From Peter Lougheed to Don Iveson, the Students’ Union has notable alumni that have
                                made their mark while on campus and have continued to do so when they leave. The Students’
                                Union for many has been a pace where they have either begun developing as a leader, or have
                                simply appreciated for the services we have provided. Alumni engagement is very much tied to
                                the experience an individual has on campus and the Students’ Union is a consistent advocate
                                for the experience that students have on campus.

                                There is currently an empty retail bay in the Students’ Union Building that needs to be
                                filled. This retail space is lost space in a student building that should not be left empty for any
                                longer than it needs to be.
                            </br>
                            However, this space does not have to be exclusively a retail space. Though food cannot
                            be served from the space, it can also be a space that is dedicated to students. Though we would
                            be losing potential revenue by not using the space as a retail bay, I would like to open up the
                            space to requests for proposals from all students. If students want to have a room full of
                            hammocks, so be it. A new computer/electronics store? Awesome. A manicure/pedicure
                            palace? Chill. The point is that this space must be filled by something that students want in SUB.
